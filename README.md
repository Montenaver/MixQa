# MixQa
An assessment project to change grade to Mix QA. The issue was:
1. Create project for testing
2. Add tests for Google search page (Selenide, TestNG)
- Open main page
- Input search request. Submit
- Check result page
3. Add tests for function that takes a date of birth as input (in any convenient form) and check that the user is 18 years old (TestNG, DataProvider)
